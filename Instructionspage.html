                    Make sure mobile/laptop is fully charged. Power bank for mobile or
                    UPS/Inverter for laptop/desktop should be arranged for uninterrupted
                    power supply.

                    Close all browsers/tabs before starting the online examination.

                <li>
                    Once the exam starts, do not switch to any other window/tab. On doing so,
                    your attempt may be considered as malpractice and your exam may get
                    terminated.

                <li>
                    Do Not Pickup/Receive the Call during the exam if you are giving the exam
                    on mobile. This also will be treated as changing the window.

                    To avoid unwanted pop-ups, use of Ad Blocker is recommended.
